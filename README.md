# Pawbook



## Description

Regardless of laws against animal abuse in México, Mexico ranks first in animals that have been abandoned to live in the streets, condemned to despair, suffering and hunger. Most of these animals came to the streets due to carelessness and negligence. Many unsterilized pups are abandoned. If they survive, in many cases they reproduce, giving birth to another generation of puppies relegated to living abroad. With this in mind, we decided to create Pawbook, to help this animals find a home.
